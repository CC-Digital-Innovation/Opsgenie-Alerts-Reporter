# PRTG-Duplicate-Device-Finder

## Summary
This script will count the total number of alerts found in Opsgenie the week before. Optionally, counts of alerts during specific timeframes during last week can also be appended to the report. Desired alerts can be specified with tags relating to relevant alerts. 
It will then email a report of these numbers.

_Note: If you have any questions or comments you can always use GitHub
discussions, or email me at farinaanthony96@gmail.com._

#### Why

the environment and related alerts to give a better picture on what types of 
alerts are being generated and why.
